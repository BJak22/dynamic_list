# dynamic_list 
In project "Dynamic list" I've created template of class named container, which is an one-way list with implemented overloaded operator [],
which make it easier to use. This project was made by me for some training.

Methods implemented in temple of class container:
- Insert - add new item to list
- read_all - show value of every node
I've also implemented oveloded operators [], =, >> and <<
with some basic exception handling.
In file "list.cpp I've made some basic tests
to check if implemented methods and operators are working correctly.
